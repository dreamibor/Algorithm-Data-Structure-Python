Description:
You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given 
stock on the ith day, and an integer k.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most k transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must 
sell the stock before you buy again).

Example:
Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), 
profit = 4-2 = 2.
