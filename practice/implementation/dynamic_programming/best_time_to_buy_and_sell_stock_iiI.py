DP - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III (hard)

Description:
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock 
on the ith day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two 
transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you 
must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example:
Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
