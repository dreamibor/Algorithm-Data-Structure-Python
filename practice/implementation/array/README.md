# Array

Array is a type of **continuous** linear data structures.

Properties:
1. Access - O(1) - with known index.
2. Insertion - O(N) 
    - worst case O(N) insert at the beginning;
    - best case O(1) insert at the end;
    - in average O(N/2) -> O(N).
3. Deletion - O(N) - similar to insertion.
