Binary Search - Median of Two Sorted Arrays (hard)

Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return 
the median of the two sorted arrays.

Example:
Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.

Follow up: The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
